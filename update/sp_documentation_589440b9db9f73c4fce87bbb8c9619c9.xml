##Two different level of reviews##&#13;
As part of Pulse we recommend always having two level of reviews happening at some point before production on the chain of instances.&#13;
&#13;
##Functional Review&#13;
During this review the process owner (Same concept as ITIL) should:&#13;
* Ensure the development meets the process needs&#13;
* Ensure it meets the standards defined&#13;
* Make sure the release notes is well written&#13;
* Clients are communicated to (if needed)&#13;
&#13;
##Technical Review&#13;
Also known as "Code Review" is the review done by technical folks getting deep into the code. The code scans helps with this work a lot, but not everything can be automatically checked.&#13;
Code reviews check for:&#13;
* Code standards (indentation, comments, debug logs)&#13;
* Coding Best Practices&#13;
* Redundant code&#13;
* Ensure that the development considered:&#13;
  * Performance / Efficiency&#13;
  * Scalability&#13;
  * Upgradeability&#13;
  * Usability / Reusability&#13;
&#13;
##Marking it as rejected/approved&#13;
The review is the same as a normal approval. You can approve/reject it from the menu item "My Approvals", from the e-mail notification, from the related list on Pulse or any other enabled method.&#13;
&#13;
##What's next?&#13;
Once all necessary reviews are completed, the development request will calculate the next phase. &#13;
* "Ready for Testing": Whenever the environment it just went to requires Testing&#13;
* "Pending Schedule": When it doesn't require testing but the next environment requires Schedule&#13;
* "Promoting": When neither testing nor schedule is needed, it will automatically move it to the next environment&#13;
Most cases the reviews are done prior to get to CERT environment and it will move to "Ready for Testing" for user acceptance testing.</content>
