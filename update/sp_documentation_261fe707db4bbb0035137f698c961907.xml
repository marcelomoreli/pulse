##What are code scan findings?##&#13;
Pulse adminstrators can configure rules for scanning updates to ensure good practices are observed.&#13;
Code scan findings appear as a related list on the the development request.&#13;

##What should I do with code scan findings on my development requests?##&#13;
Hovering over the Lead Comments will reveal the full text.&#13;

&#13;
Users with the x_wms_pulse.developer_lead role are able to update the Lead Comments when needed to send a personalized message to the developer.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
In the case that scan issues are expected, developers can enter Developer Comments, which must then be reviewed by a developer lead.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
A developer lead must select an Action for the disputed findings. The possible actions are:&#13;
* Accept: the lead accepts the developer comments and the finding will not prevent code promotion&#13;
* Ignore: the lead may choose ignore at any point if a finding is a false positive&#13;
* Remediate: the lead may choose remediate, which will prevent the code from promoting until the finding has been dealt with or a subsequent scan does not trigger the finding&#13;
&#13;
***A development request cannot be promoted while unaddressed code scan findings exist!***&#13;
